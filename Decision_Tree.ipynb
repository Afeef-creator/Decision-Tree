        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "A Decision Tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression.\n",
        "In classification, it works by splitting the dataset into smaller subsets based on feature values.\n",
        "Each internal node represents a decision rule, each branch represents the outcome of that rule,\n",
        "and each leaf node represents a class label.\n",

        "How do they impact the splits in a Decision Tree?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "Gini Impurity measures how often a randomly chosen sample would be incorrectly classified.\n",
        "Lower Gini value indicates higher purity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Entropy measures the randomness or uncertainty in the dataset.\n",
        "Lower entropy means the data is more pure.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "Pre-Pruning stops the tree growth early by setting limits like maximum depth.\n",
        "Its advantage is reduced overfitting and faster training.\n",
        "\n",
        "Post-Pruning allows the tree to grow fully and then removes unnecessary branches.\n",

        "Information Gain measures the reduction in entropy after splitting the dataset on a feature.\n",
        "A higher Information Gain means the feature provides more useful information.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is important because it helps select the feature that best separates the data into pure classes.\n",
